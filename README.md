### License: This is a draft (alpha) version, not for public release. Do not share, cite or copy.

Notes:
 1. This version does not support multiple crops in rotation or multiple cover crop types
 2. To implement mixed cover crops, the result should be the mean of leguminous and non-leguminous cover crops.
 3. To implement multiple crops in a rotation, the result should be the weighted mean of the individual result for each crop. Weights are the relative frequency of planting of each crop in the rotation.
